Basic_Arithmetic() is a simple Python function that takes two numbers as input from the user and performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The results of each operation are printed to the console.

How to Use:

	1.	Run the script.
	2.	Enter a value for a when prompted.
	3.	Enter a value for b when prompted.
	4.	The function will display the results of a + b, a - b, a * b, and a / b.

#3
String_Manipulation() is a simple Python function that prompts the user to input their name and then greets them with a personalized message.

How to Use:

	1.	Run the script.
	2.	Enter your name when prompted.
	3.	The function will display a greeting message with your name.


#4
This script defines a list of universities and demonstrates basic list operations in Python. It displays the complete list of universities and prints the first and last universities in the list.

How to Use:

	1.	Run the script.
	2.	The script will display the list of universities.
	3.	It will then print the first university in the list and the last university using indexing.

#5
Dictionaries() is a Python function that defines a dictionary containing information about students, including their names, ages, and grades. It then extracts and displays each student’s details using a loop.

How to Use:

	1.	Run the script.
	2.	The function defines a dictionary of students with their ages and grades.
	3.	It extracts the names of the students and iterates through each entry.
	4.	For each student, their name, age, and grade are printed in a formatted output.

#6
coordinates and demonstrates how to access its values using indexing. It prints the complete tuple, followed by the X and Y values separately.

How to Use:

	1.	Run the script.
	2.	The script will display the tuple of coordinates.
	3.	It will then print the X value (first element) and the Y value (second element) using indexing.

#7
This script demonstrates basic operations with Python sets, focusing on adding, removing, and merging elements.

How to Use:

	1.	A set of colors is defined initially: {"red", "green", "blue"}.
	2.	The script adds “yellow” to the set and prints the updated set.
	3.	It then attempts to add “red” again, demonstrating that sets do not allow duplicate values.

#8
This script prompts the user to input a number and determines whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.

#9
This script defines a list of numbers and iterates through each element, printing each number in the list.

#10
This script defines a list of numbers and uses a for loop to iterate through each element. If the number 5 is encountered, the loop prints a message and terminates; otherwise, it prints each number until the loop is stopped.

#11
This script prompts the user to enter a grade (A, B, C, D, F) and uses a match statement to display a corresponding message based on the input. If the input does not match any valid grade, it returns an error message.

#12
This script defines a function greet(name) that takes a name as input and prints a personalized greeting message. The function is called with a name to display the greeting.

#13
This script defines a function square(number) that returns the square of a given number. It then demonstrates the function by printing the squares of 2, 5, and 10.

#14
This script defines a function multiply(a, b=1) that multiplies two numbers. It takes two arguments, with b having a default value of 1. The function is demonstrated by multiplying 4 and 5, and then 7 with the default value of b.

#15
This script defines a list of numbers and uses list comprehension to create a new list containing the squares of each number. It then prints the list of squared values.

#16
This script defines a dictionary of students with their respective grades and calculates the average grade for each student. It then prints each student’s name along with their average grade, formatted to two decimal places.

#17
This script defines a function calculate(num1, num2, operator) that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) based on the operator provided by the user. It handles division by zero and invalid operators with appropriate error messages. The user is prompted to enter two numbers and an operator, and the script outputs the calculated result.

FizzBuzz in Python

A simple Python function that prints numbers from 1 to n with the following rules:

	•	Prints "Fizz" for numbers divisible by 3.
	•	Prints "Buzz" for numbers divisible by 5.
	•	Prints "FizzBuzz" for numbers divisible by both 3 and 5.
	•	Prints the number itself if none of the above conditions are met.
